<p>Hi there! My name is Leonard! I'm a 29 year old gay man who lives in Washington, DC.</p>

<p>A friend of mine recently asked me if I would ever date someone else named Leonard. I laughed. I've only met a handful of Leonards in my entire life, and none of them (that I know of) were gay. So I expect the chances of meeting another gay Leonard - not to mention dating another gay Leonard - would be very slim.</p>

<p>However, I think it would be very funny. So if you're Leonard, you're gay, and you'd like to go on a date, drop me a line. It probably won't work out, but it might, and then we'd be the Leonards. But even if it doesn't, it would still be hilarious.</p>
