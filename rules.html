<p class="question">My name isn't Leonard, but I'd still like to go on a date sometime.</p>

<p class="answer">Um, okay. You don't count for the purposes of this project, but I'm game. Send me an email.</p>

<p class="question">My last name is Leonard. Do I count?</p>

<p class="answer">Nah. That's cheating. Unless you go by "Leonard" in your day-to-day life.</p>

<p class="question">My first name is Leonard, but I don't go by Leonard. I go by John or Bob or whatever my middle name is. Do I count?</p>

<p class="answer">Nope. You've gotta go by Leonard in your day-to-day life.</p>

<p class="question">My first name is Leonard, but I go by "Leo" or "Lenny" or "Leon" or some other variation in my day-to-day life. Do I count?</p>

<p class="answer">Sure.</p>

<p class="question">I was born in August, so I'm a Leo! I count, right?</p>

<p class="answer">No, that's just silly.</p>

<p class="question">Too bad Leonard Bernstein is dead.</p>

<p class="answer">I know, right?</p>
